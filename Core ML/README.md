# üß† Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains clean and well-documented implementations of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms** built entirely **from scratch** using Python and NumPy ‚Äî without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

These notebooks are designed to help you understand the **core mathematical logic and algorithmic intuition** behind each model.
